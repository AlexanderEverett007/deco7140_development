                <p>
                    Throughout the website development process, I actively
                    utilized generative AI (GenAI) tools to enhance efficiency,
                    productivity, and creativity. My experience provided
                    insights into the significant benefits and clear limitations
                    of such technology, alongside an appreciation of ethical
                    considerations in practical use.

                <!-- English: Subheading for the first scenario -->
                <!-- 中文: 第一个场景的小标题 -->
                <h2>Color Selection for Mental Health Theme</h2>
                <p>
                    One notable experience involved using AI to select
                    appropriate colors for card elements intended to support a
                    mental health theme. Despite clearly instructing the AI to
                    choose colors with a bright, cheerful tone to evoke
                    positivity, the tool initially produced dark, subdued, and
                    melancholic shades. This scenario highlighted an inherent
                    limitation of AI: it relies heavily on interpretation based
                    on extensive but generalized training data, which may not
                    always align with nuanced, domain-specific requirements such
                    as mental health sensitivity. Recognizing this limitation
                    compelled me to critically engage with AI outputs, rather
                    than passively accepting them, underscoring the importance
                    of human oversight in AI-assisted design processes.

                <h2>Rigid Design Structures and Prompt Engineering</h2>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I encountered another significant challenge
                    regarding the rigidity of AI-generated design structures.
                    Initially, the AI consistently suggested repetitive, uniform
                    design elements, creating a monotonous user experience
                    across the entire webpage. However, by initiating
                    personalized and iterative dialogues with the AI, clearly
                    articulating my need for greater diversity and creative
                    variation, I was able to guide it toward generating more
                    individualized, dynamic, and engaging designs. This
                    experience demonstrated the effectiveness of refined prompt
                    engineering, an essential strategy to optimize AI outputs
                    and enhance their practical utility.

                <!-- English: Subheading for ethical considerations -->
                <!-- 中文: 伦理考量的小标题 -->
                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    From an ethical standpoint, my engagement with GenAI
                    emphasized responsible and transparent use. I maintained
                    academic integrity by transparently documenting AI
                    contributions in the project's metadata, clearly
                    distinguishing AI-generated components from my original
                    work. Moreover, recognizing the potential for inadvertent
                    bias or inappropriate thematic representations (such as the
                    mental health colors incident) reinforced the importance of
                    human judgment to ethically moderate AI outputs.

                <h2>Future Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I aim to further integrate innovative
                    strategies into my professional practice. Firstly,
                    developing sophisticated prompt engineering skills will
                    remain a priority, enabling precise communication of nuanced
                    requirements to AI tools. Secondly, systematically adopting
                    an iterative approach—initial AI output followed by targeted
                    refinement through subsequent interactions—will be crucial
                    to overcoming inherent limitations of AI-generated designs.
                    Lastly, establishing clear ethical guidelines and
                    transparency protocols will ensure responsible and effective
                    use of AI, preserving both integrity and creative control.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, my experience using GenAI tools was both
                    instructive and transformative, substantially enhancing
                    productivity and creativity despite occasional shortcomings.
                    Through critical reflection on the effectiveness,
                    limitations, and ethical considerations of AI usage, coupled
                    with innovative strategies for future improvements, I am
                    confident in integrating these powerful tools more
                    effectively into my future professional endeavors.
