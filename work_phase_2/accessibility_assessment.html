                <p>
                    This website is developed in alignment with the WCAG 2.2
                    guidelines to ensure accessibility, inclusivity, and
                    usability for users with diverse needs. It focuses on the
                    following principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Perceivable:</strong> Content must be presented
                        in ways that users can perceive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Operable:</strong> Interface components must be
                        operable via different input methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and UI must
                        be easy to understand and use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be compatible with
                        assistive technologies.

                <h2>Relevant Success Criteria & Client/User Needs</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the client brief and user interviews (Aisha, David,
                    Lily), we identified the following relevant success
                    criteria:
                </p>

                <h3>1.1.1 Alternative Text for Non-Text Content</h3>
                <p>
                    Helps users like Aisha, who benefit from visual cues due to
                    limited English proficiency. Alternative text ensures icons
                    and images are meaningful and accessible.
                </p>

                <h3>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensures that content is presented in a logical order for
                    screen readers, supporting Aisha's need for simplified,
                    non-overwhelming content.
                </p>

                <h3>1.4.3 Perceivable Text Contrast</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensures readability across different devices, especially
                    helpful for users like Lily who access the site on mobile
                    with limited lighting conditions.
                </p>

                <h3>1.4.4 Resize Text without Loss</h3>
                <p>
                    Supports users with limited literacy or vision by allowing
                    zooming without breaking the layout, improving usability
                    across all demographics.
                </p>

                <h3>2.1.1 Keyboard Navigability</h3>
                <p>
                    Essential for mobile navigation and low-tech users like
                    Aisha, who use only a phone and need intuitive tab-based
                    access.
                </p>

                <h3>2.4.7 Focus Visible</h3>
                <p>
                    Highlights navigation focus for users with limited technical
                    literacy, enhancing clarity when browsing with a keyboard or
                    screen reader.
                </p>

                <h3>3.1.5 Reading Level</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensures that text is understandable for non-native speakers
                    like Aisha and Lily by using plain language and avoiding
                    jargon.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2.3 Consistent Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    Reduces confusion for users like David who value
                    professionalism and clarity in layout and interaction.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2.4 Consistent Identification (Layout & UI Behaviour)</h3>
                <p>
                    Ensures familiar interactions throughout the site, which is
                    critical for trust-building as mentioned by both Lily and
                    David.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3.2 Labels & Instructions</h3>
                <p>
                    Supports input clarity for newcomers like Aisha, ensuring
                    forms and UI elements are labeled with clear instructions to
                    avoid confusion.
                </p>

            <section class="accessibility-box">
                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>
                    The selected criteria reflect the mission of the Connect
                    Communities Initiative by promoting inclusion, clarity, and
                    accessibility. Each guideline directly supports the needs of
                    specific users:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Aisha:</strong> Benefits from clean UI, visual
                        cues, text alternatives, and low reading level content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>David:</strong> Needs professional, consistent
                        design with intuitive navigation and accessible forms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lily:</strong> Requires a mobile-friendly design
                        with high contrast, readable layout, and simple,
                        trustable content.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Meeting these criteria enables the website to be accessible,
                    trustworthy, and usable for the targeted community groups.
