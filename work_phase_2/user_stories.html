                            language barriers and overwhelming information. Many
                            websites only partially support Arabic, making her
                            feel confused and anxious. She emphasized the need

                            (icons/images), and compatibility with slow

                                When I first came to Australia, I needed to find
                                help for many things—healthcare, English
                                classes, how to rent a home. I searched online,
                                but many websites were confusing.There were too
                                many words, and I didn’t know which one to
                                trust. Sometimes, I didn’t even know the right
                                words to type into Google. I asked my son to
                                help me, but he is also still learning.

                        2. What challenges have you faced when looking for help

                                full translation.Some buttons or pages stay in
                                English. Also, websites have too much
                                information at once. I get lost. Some ask me to
                                fill forms, but I don’t know what they mean. I
                                worry I will do something wrong. Also, sometimes
                                websites don’t work well on my phone. I don’t
                                have a computer, only my phone.

                                Sometimes they don’t open. And if the English is
                                too difficult, I just give up. I feel tired and
                                stressed. I would rather go to the community
                                centre and ask in person, but not always
                                possible. So I need websites that are easy and
                                work fast, even with slow internet.

                                using Google Ads too, but without solid SEO,
                                it’s hard to get organic traffic. I also

                                Product Hunt or Reddit, but it’s a lot to

                                testimonials, and a simple way to contact us. If
